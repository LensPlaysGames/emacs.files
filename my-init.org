This file is meant to be customized in any way you see fit!
The only reason it exists is to serve as both an example and to
minimize re-writing. To add Emacs Lisp into your initialization, just
type it into a source block exactly like the one seen below.

#+begin_example
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :mkdirp yes :tangle my-init.el
  ;; Code goes here
#+end_src
#+end_example
